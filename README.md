# Twitch-Chess

A chess game in which you play against your twitch chat. 

## How It works

1. Enter your channel name (like "gempir")
2. Start playing as the white player
3. Once you made a move, the bot will look for the most popular move in your chat in the next X seconds. 
4. If no votes were cast in chat, then the bot will execute a random move
