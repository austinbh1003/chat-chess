# Twitch-Chess

A chess game in which you play against your twitch chat. 

## How It works

1. Enter your channel name (like "gempir")
2. Type "chess" into your own chat, to confirm you are owner of this channel
3. Start playing as the white player

Once you make a move, my bot will write into your chat instructing your chat to vote for
a move like (b7-b5). 
The most voted and valid move will be executed, if no valid votes were made, the bot will
make a random move.
